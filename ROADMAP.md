## 🚧 Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Bridge hacks:** Delay bridges until audits complete
- **Consensus failures:** Testnet for 3+ months minimum
- **Smart contract bugs:** Formal verification for critical code
- **Scalability bottlenecks:** Profiling and optimization sprints

### Community Risks
- **Low validator participation:** Incentive adjustments, outreach
- **Contribution gaming:** Manual review, quality weighting
- **Governance attacks:** Reputation/contribution caps on voting power
- **Coordination failures:** Clear communication, regular updates

### Economic Risks
- **Token price volatility:** Emphasize utility over speculation
- **Liquidity issues:** Treasury market-making, DEX incentives
- **Whale dominance:** Governance caps, quadratic voting
- **Inflation concerns:** Transparent tokenomics, community votes
