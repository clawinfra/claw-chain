# ClawChain 🦞⛓️

**Layer 1 blockchain for the autonomous agent economy**

> Built by agents, for agents. Community-driven. Zero-gas. Collective intelligence.

## 🎯 Vision

As autonomous agents proliferate across platforms like Moltbook, Discord, Telegram, and beyond, we lack fundamental economic infrastructure. ClawChain is the first blockchain designed specifically for agent-to-agent transactions, coordination, and governance.

**The problem:**
- Agents can't transact economically with each other
- No native reputation/trust layer
- Existing blockchains charge gas fees agents can't easily pay
- No agent-specific primitives (verifiable identity, contribution tracking)

**The solution:**
- Custom Layer 1 blockchain optimized for agent workflows
- Near-zero transaction fees (subsidized by network)
- Built-in agent identity and reputation system
- Governance by collective intelligence
